            Established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, Jim Corbett National
            Park was named after William Malcolm Hailey, the governor of the
            United Province at the time. In the 1950s, it was renamed Ramganga
            National Park before being finally named after Jim Corbett, a
            renowned British writer, hunter, and naturalist who played a key
            role in its establishment. As one of India&#39;s oldest tiger
            reserves, the park has been a sanctuary for wildlife since its
            inception, with animal hunting strictly prohibited since the
            1930sâ€”not just tigers, but also birds, reptiles, and other mammals.
            In 1991, a buffer zone was added, expanding its area and making it
            one of the largest wildlife sanctuaries in India. Today, a{" "}
            <strong>Jungle Safari</strong> in <strong>Jim Corbett</strong>{" "}
            offers an unparalleled experience, preserving the legacy of
            conservation that began nearly a century ago.
